# Development samples

All samples under this repository are minimal samples created to test Prism in a real application during development. This enables the team to proof and validate more complex functionality (e.g. navigation) without the need to create new NuGet packages during development.

These samples are no replacement for the unit test suite that covers the code base.

# Stable samples

More complete samples showing how to use Prism 6 for your application development will be posted in separate repositories under the [PrismLibrary GitHub organization](https://github.com/PrismLibrary). These samples are based on public released NuGet packages and are thus more stable than the development samples.
